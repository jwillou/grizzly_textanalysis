The others are unpredictable. The grizzlies tend to feed during springtime on carcasses of elk and bison that died during the winter. When the winters are less harsh as they have been recently there are fewer carcasses to give the bears immediate access to protein-rich food as they emerge from their winter dens.

Its not like the Wilderness Act where places must forever remain listed after theyve been designated. The ESA needs success stories to strengthen the law and the Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery is the greatest success story of all.,,The Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem which spans 9600 square miles in northwestern Montana and includes Glacier National Park is home to an estimated 960 grizzly bears. A century ago Yellowstones grizzlies mingled and procreated with these northern neighbors and one goal of the 1993 Recovery Plan was to re-unite the two groups. But today more than 150 treacherous miles of farmland and roadways still separate the populations.Servheen however is confident the two populations will soon connect aided by projects to help the animals bridge highways like 1-90 which cuts the two populations in half. Even without connectivity the Yellowstone population is genetically healthy says Servheen. Its not a small isolated population; its a large isolated population.,We have three times as many bears occupying more than twice the range we did when we started says Servheen. Thats in spite of the fact that grizzly bears or Ursus arctos horribilis are the second slowest-reproducing land animal in North America just behind the musk ox taking two or three years to rear a single litter of cubs. And unlike most other listed species they sometimes kill human beings. Since 1872 grizzlies have killed eight people in Yellowstone National Park. And yet weve done it Servheen says. Thats a good story.,,,,,,,

That’s why the Endangered Species Act is really importing at giving people the extra nudge toward what needs to be done. If you remove the Endangered Species Act you won’t have those resources.,,Mattson a recently retired wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey noted that in the early 1800s an estimated 47000 grizzly bears roamed across North America but the population dropped by 98% by the time they were listed as a threatened species in 1975. Today’s population whether it’s 1700 or 2000 still represents only 4% of how many once were here.Does that constitute recovery in light of the magnitude of the losses? Mattson asked. It’s a relatively small isolated population that also faces severe threats.,,People can learn from each other and there’s also incentives and disincentives we can provide Mattson said. A lot of people don’t want grizzly bears where they’re living but will live with them if the incentive is right. But for a lot of people it’s easier to pick up the phone and call Wildlife Serivces to kill the bears.,,,,,He said that some people argue that the bears’ populations are increasing because they’re moving out of the high country into the foothills and plains but that might not be true. The loss of food sources from wildfires and climate change instead could be pushing them back into their historical ranges which now are occupied by humans.

The Final Rule discusses the recovery strategy for lower-48-States grizzly bears including the Recovery Plan which provided management goals for six different grizzly bear populations identified by ecosystems. The Recovery Plan identifies unique demographic recovery criteria for each ecosystem population and states that it is the Services goal to delist individual populations as they recover. Thus the Services action in delisting the GYE DPS is consistent with the Recovery Plan. The GYE population is the first of the six populations to recover. We note however that the population in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem may be eligible for delisting in the near future. The Services data indicates that this population has likely met recovery goals. Other populations may be uplisted downlisted or delisted based on their overall health and numbers.,,,,,,,

Instead the agency is trying to find low-impact ways to log such as logging in the winter when bears are hibernating or helicopter logging.The new rules also propose opening some roads on a seasonal basis that had previously been closed to vehicles. Land managers have said that without some concessions to local residents who oppose road closures bears may become the target of their animosity.,,

In a paper he co-wrote that is scheduled to be published in the journal Ecology Mattson wrote that the Yellowstone grizzly bear population changed little from 1975 to 1995 and that fluctuations in the population had more to do with cycles in a key food source -- whitebark pine nuts -- than with government protections.,,,,,,,Pine nuts are an important fall food source for grizzlies as they pack on fat for the winter. Because whitebark pine is a high-elevation species this food source also helps bears avoid the kind of conflicts with people that are the prime cause of their mortality.Mattson and others point to other food source threats that argue against a hasty decision to declare Yellowstones grizzlies recovered.The Yellowstone cutthroat trout population in Yellowstone Lake which provides a rich source of protein for dozens of bears during the spring spawning run is threatened by the illegal introduction of lake trout that prey on the smaller cutthroat. It is also likely there will be fewer bison for grizzlies to feed on once a new bison management plan is in place that will probably result in a far smaller herd. And army cutworm moths which congregate on steep rocky slopes at high altitude and are another important food source may be susceptible to global warming trends.

Rather it called for a plan to address genetic diversity concerns in the Yellowstone ecosystem and the Northern Rockies more broadly. A plan could include increased protections for connectivity habitats and installation of highway passage structures to enhance natural movements as recommended by the Montana Grizzly Bear Advisory Council. 2) If delisting is achieved for more than 90% of the grizzly bears in the lower 48 states FWS would be powerless to stop broken promises habitat loss lax implementation of Conservation Strategies hunting seasons shooting by ranchers and other killings of grizzly bears.,Delisting the Yellowstone and NCDE populations would certainly be a death certificate for untold numbers of grizzly bears. Trucking grizzly bears is a cynical ploy that does not have the bears’ best interests at heart. Nor is it likely to succeed.First the proposal is manipulative intrusive and easily a two-day operation extremely stressful for the bears. After drugging handling and being towed in a trap over busy highways the bears get dumped into a crowded space with unfamiliar foods.

The ruling will impede efforts by the Clinton Administration to delist the species prematurely and expose the animals to continuing habitat destruction sport hunting and other destructive activities.,,,,,Judge Friedman rejected parts of the grizzly recovery plan because they failed to address the threat of disease to bear populations.

Several reasons are provided. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is conducting a status review based on three petitions to de-list the grizzly bear two of which would de-list the grizzly in the GYE. Upon completion of the evaluation the FWS may choose to alter the listing status of any of the petitioned populations.This bill attempts to bypass the species status assessment and congressionally de-list the grizzly bear in the GYE and prevent any similar listing in the future.The passage of this bill would circumvent the FWS review process that is currently ongoing and being conducted by experts in their field based on the best available science. If supporters of this bill believe that the best available science points to recovery and warrants the de-listing of grizzly populations in the GYE then they should present relevant data to the FWS and feel confident that an appropriate listing decision will be made. The current FWS review will be over in less than 12 months with an announcement expected in February 2024. The rush for RePublicans to bring this legislation forward before the FWS results are published lends doubt to their claims that state management is adequate to protect the grizzly from future harm and underscores the need for an unbiased scientific review of the facts to determine species listing and de-listing under the ESA.Further many Native Americans value the grizzly bear in ways that are not--and cannot be--accounted for under the ESA. Their concerns should be considered in the future of grizzly management. Blocking judicial review removes a vital avenue for Public and tribal recourse on grizzly management issues. The bill ignores federal trust responsibilities with tribes and skips tribal consultation leaving tribes entirely out of the process.Raul M.

This bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to remove the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem populations of grizzly bears from the list of endangered and threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).,The science does not support keeping the Grizzly Bear listed under the Endangered Species Act. But unfortunately as a result of serial litigation at the behest of radical environmentalists the species continues to be listed as threatened today Representative Rosendale said. This puts the lives of Montanans and the livelihoods of Montana ranchers in jeopardy. Its high time we follow the science and pass my bill to delist the grizzly bear populations in the Northern Continental Divide and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystems and return management back to the states.,,,There is a larger population of grizzly bears today in Montana alone than there were across all the lower 48 states when the species was designated as threatened. The grizzly bear populations in each ecosystem now far exceed the recovery targets that were set. Despite this significant growth in grizzly bear populations the species remains listed as threatened under the ESA-ignoring the science which shows that grizzly bear populations have more than recovered.,,As a result of this mismanagement human-bear encounters have risen dramatically as grizzly bear populations expand into historically unpopulated territory--posing a life-threatening risk to the residents who live in these areas.

It directs the secretary of the Interior to re-issue the final rule delisting the grizzly bear that was published on June 30 2017. 2)It protects the re-issuance of that final rule from judicial review.  3) In 2016 the Obama administration recognized the grizzly bears full recovery when it published a proposed rule delisting the grizzly bear.It concluded - [T]he Yellowstone grizzly bear population has rebounded from as few as 136 bears in 1975 to an estimated 700 or more today. Grizzly bears have more than doubled their range since the mid-1970s and now occupy more than 22500 square mile of the ecosystem. Stable population numbers for grizzly bears for more than a decade also indicate that the [Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem] is at or near its carrying capacity for the bears. In 2017 the Trump administration agreed with the Obama administrations findings. It finalized President Obamas proposed rule delisting the grizzly bear.It also credited the states of Wyoming Montana and Idaho with adopting necessary post-delisting plans and regulations that ensure the species remains recovered under state management.Yet again a liberal federal judge overturned the delisting rule.                                                                                                               4)The Grizzly Bear State Management Act will help address this by giving back to states the authority they need - and have earned - to manage the grizzly bear.5)It will recognize the full recovery of the grizzly bear and delist it once and for all.6)It will honor the conservation investment of people throughout Wyoming Montana and Idaho - and improve the Public safety of our communities.,,That rule was overturned by a liberal federal judge based on an environmental groups claim that a particular food source for the grizzly bear had not been adequately considered during the rulemaking.The importance of that food source was later debunked in a scientific review by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee.,,The grizzly bear in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is fully recovered. End of story. It is one of the greatest recovery successes since the Endangered Species Act was enacted in 1973. It is a conservation triumph led by the people of Wyoming Montana and Idaho. It is a triumph that all Americans should celebrate. President Bush President Obama and President Trump agree. Under each of their administrations the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that the grizzly bear is fully recovered and should be delisted. Wyoming Montana and Idaho fist achieved all of the grizzly bears recovery objectives in 1997 - 23 years ago. By 2003 they had met all of its recovery objectives for six consecutive years - the standard required by the 1993 Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan.,, As the grizzly bear has rebounded conflicts with humans have increased. As the grizzly bear has rebounded conflicts with humans have increased.Members of Wyomings Upper Green River Cattle Association have lost over 1000 head of cattle since 1995.In 2018 the Wyoming Game and Fish Department had to capture 53 individual grizzly bears to prevent or resolve conflicts.These bears not only mauled livestock but tragically killed a Wyoming elk hunting guide and injured his client.This year grizzly bear attacks injuring humans are happening at a record rate.By July 1 seven people were attacked and injured by grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem - more than the first six months of any other year since data was first collected in 1992.This is a higher total than six of the previous ten years - an unsettling trend since over 80 percent of conflicts generally occur in the second half of the year.,,Since 1980 - 40 years ago - the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has spent more than $50 million in grizzly bear recovery. The states of Montana and Idaho and stakeholders throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem have invested millions more.,,,

Grrzzly bears once ranged throughout the traditional-territory of the Northern Cheyenne people including lands within the boundaries of the Northern-Cheyenne Reservation in southeast Montana./l However like the territory of the Northeru Cheyenne people the range of the grrzzly bear was vastly diminished as the result of encroachment by settlers and prospectors beginning in the 19th century. Since that time grizzly-bears in the region have been limited to Yellowstone National Park and surrounding areas and-they are no longer present on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.The Northern Cheyenne people view the grizzly bear as a spiritual relative and have great respect-for the bears strength and power as well as its right to live free from harm. We believe that the-Creator gave the grizzly bear a spirit in the same way that the Creator gave us a spirit and that-the grizzly bear has a right to exist and to be left alone. We believe that the Tribe has a sacred-responsibility to speak for the grrzzly bear which cannot speak for itself. In our view this is-equivalent to our obligation to speak on behalf of members of our family when they are unable to-speak up for their own interests.I Final Rule Removing the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Population of Grizzly Bears From the Federal List of-Endangered and Threatened Wildlife 82 Fed.

We are aware that it is the states that are driving the delisting and the trophy hunting of the grizzly bear and that the federal government is bowing to the states. The states need to cease and desist Tyler explains. 3) There has been no meaningful consultation with us on this issue by our trustees the federal government Tyler continued. Under Executive Order 13175 that was implemented by President Clinton and which has been reaffirmed by President Obama a meaningful consultation process is supposed to be followed by all federal agencies when decisions are being made that affect Indian tribes. This is a fiduciary trust responsibility which has been disregarded by FWS in its attempts to delist the grizzly bear from the ESA. 4) The consultation process should be initiated at the beginning of any type of proposal or project that may impact and concern us as sovereign nations and treaty tribes. What is occurring here in this push to delist the grizzly bear without thorough and meaningful consultation with tribes should never happen again. We dont want to hear about the rule to delist the grizzly bear after the fact insists Vice Chairman Tyler. 5) Returning the grizzly to tribal lands and tribes being partners in managing grizzlies and formulating their own grizzly bear management plans that reflect our cultural values is an issue that needs to be addressed says Tyler. This will move us towards returning to a balance. There must be a balance but right now there is no balance and our Mother Earth is sick.,,,Our treaty the 1868 Fort Bridger Treaty was prior to the foundation of the states but today states are implementing and forcing authority without asking or following the proper channels. We are aware that it is the states that are driving the delisting and the trophy hunting of the grizzly bear and that the federal government is bowing to the states. The states need to cease and desist Tyler explains.,

Democrats Abroad said (SHARE) is a nightmare for human life wildlife and Public lands. The bill is chock-full of anti-wildlife anti-Endangered Species Act and anti-Public lands provisions that would undermine wildlife conservation and put imperiled species in greater danger.,,,,,Quote from article: My specific distrust of turning brown bear management over to the states arises from how notoriously slow the departments have been to investigate and prosecute obvious cases of poaching protecting illegal killers who—when caught—claim they felt threatened in some way—the self-defense argument. Subsequent prosecution is slack or non-existent. To justify this lax enforcement the state game managers say that if they prosecute poaching too aggressively their sources of information about bear-mortality reporting will dry up. Still if delisting survives its legal challenges and a hunting season is opened illegal killing of grizzlies will become much easier (with or without a license) and will loom as the primary threat to Yellowstone’s entire bear population.,,,,Quote from article: I believe these national groups have become involved with the fate of grizzlies in order to serve a broader agenda: converting Public land to private ownership. To put it bluntly stealing the land that belongs to all of us and delivering it to the private sector for financial exploitation. They would auction off the vast wild lands of the Bureau of Land Management national forests and wildlife refuges and open national monuments and even the national parks to resource extraction.All Public lands are threatened by this so-called states rights movement.: It’s not just the Yellowstone ecosystem and Bear’s Ears mesas that are imperiled but also the underlying philosophy and concepts that made these places possible in the first place. The Wilderness Endangered Species and Antiquities acts are all under siege. The NRA and Safari Club agendas on wildlife and wilderness issues at their core are driven by the desire to dismantle our wild heritage.,Quote from article: So it was no surprise when the NRA and Safari Club asked to intervene in a lawsuit over the fate of Yellowstone National Park’s grizzly bear population. Their intent is to support the federal decision to remove the bears’ Endangered Species Act protections and allow trophy hunting of Yellowstone’s grizzlies.Five NRA and Safari Club members said in affidavits submitted by their attorneys that hunting grizzlies would help the regions economy allow states to better manage the animals and improve Public safety. These five outfitters and big game hunters claim their interests would be harmed if they could not have the opportunity to hunt Yellowstone’s grizzlies.The core argument is Public safety: that hunting bears will make people safer by instilling in grizzlies a fear of humans. These groups claim that Yellowstone’s grizzlies have become too aggressive and that a fear of people would make bears shy and more subordinate thus benefiting Public safety. The unexamined assumption is that bears learn by being shot at.,

The Yellowstone and Grand Teton parks make up only half of the six million-acre grizzly bear ecosystem. In the mix of other land ownership there are large tracts of private property. Some counties around the park are among the fastest growing in the country. Farms and homes can attract bears with garbage and dog food and when a bear becomes habituated or loses its fear of humans it often needs to be moved out of the ecosystem or ends up being shot. Elk hunters who find a grizzly and shoot it in self-defense also account for a large share of grizzly deaths.,,Quote from article: A Disease called blister rust which kills whitebark pines has made its way into areas north and west of Yellowstone destroying most of the trees.

As the number of bears in the Yellowstone population fell to its low point of 200 in the early 1970s collective genetic diversity fell too. The degree of loss can only be estimated but the estimates raise concern. The important points to understand here are that small (and smallish) populations inexorably lose genetic diversity with each passing generation through a random process called genetic drift and that when sheer population size rebounds genetic diversity does not rebound with it.Genetic impoverishment becomes worse not better with each generation when a small population remains small. Inbreeding adds to the consequences of such impoverishment. And we can assume that the 600 Yellowstone grizzlies are now roughly as inbred as if theyd descended from 200 cousins second cousins and cousins once or twice removed left to mate together on a desert island 30 years ago.,Quote from article: Yellowstone is an island growing smaller every year we shouldnt delude ourselves that its grizzlies have recovered in any but the most tenuous and misleading numerical sense.

Studies show that the bears are wide-ranging omnivores eating everything from ladybugs and moths to earthworms plant roots grass and wild berries.

Critics say the states lack the money and expertise to protect the bears. But last year Wyoming spent more than $2 million on grizzly bear research problem animals and Public education efforts. Whats more the wildlife agencies in those states are already managing many large mammals including mountain lions elk American pronghorn bighorn sheep mountain goats and moose. Its wrongheaded to suggest that they are like teenagers waiting to rebel once their parents leave town,,,,,Quote from article: Finally it is likely that Montana Idaho and Wyoming will use hunting as a tool to deter bears from occupying areas with high risks of human-grizzly conflicts. But any hunting will be tightly regulated. The killing of females with cubs or of unaccompanied cubs will be illegal. Any grizzly killed by a hunter will be counted toward a mortality ceiling that will also include bears killed by cars and even natural causes. Once that threshold is met hunting will be cut off. If the cap is exceeded those deaths will be counted against the next year. This will ensure a thriving stable population.If a grizzly hunt is too painful for some to endure consider what will happen if the delisting of grizzlies is blocked by lawsuits. The credibility of the Endangered Species Act will continue to erode. There is a limit to political and Public tolerance for sacrifice on behalf of wildlife. It should not be wasted on those species that have recovered especially when weve got so many more waiting in line.,

It also demonstrates Americas enduring commitment to wildlife conservation.  2) According to the Endangered Species Act once a species meets the goals set for its recovery federal protection as a listed species must cease as long as adequate regulatory mechanisms are in place so the species will not again decline. To ensure adequate regulatory mechanisms a comprehensive strategy has been developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the Forest Service and the state fish and wildlife agencies in Montana Wyoming and Idaho. This comprehensive strategy specifies the habitat and population protections for the grizzly population and its habitat following delisting. It represents a good deal for grizzly bears.,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore we used the PAD‐US to assess the composition of lands within each 5% greater ecosystem bin. We assessed whether lands within greater ecosystems surrounding protected areas were federal state or other and which GAP Status those lands were assigned. GAP Status is a classification of the conservation protection where GAP Status 1 and 2 are lands where biodiversity protection is mandated land cover conversion is prevented and commercial activities like mining and logging are limited. GAP Status 3 lands are managed to protected biodiversity and limit land cover conversion but allow commercial extractive activities. GAP Status 4 lands are managed by federal agencies but typically have unknown conservation mandates and policies. GAP Status 3 lands are largely dominated by lands managed by federal agencies (e.g. the U.S. Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management) but without formal protection (e.g. wilderness designation). We assume that federal and state land (Publicly‐managed lands) and lands with a higher GAP Status would provide greater feasibility and opportunities for elevating the level of conservation protection of lands within delineated greater ecosystem bins. In some cases greater ecosystems that are not part of our pool of protected areas include lands already protected (i.e. classified as GAP Status 1 or 2) but these protected units may not share a boundary or otherwise meet the criteria for inclusion in our pool of protected areas.,,However conservation scientists increasingly recognize that isolated protected areas unconnected to a network may be limited in their ability to maintain biodiversity and ecological functions especially under mounting pressures of land use and climate change (Belote et al. ; McGuire Lawler McRae Nuñez & Theobald ; Ordonez Martinuzzi & Radelo ).

According to the Goal Tribal Coalition [www.goaltribal.org) the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho of the Wind River Reservation are especially concerned about delisting because the State of Wyoming has identified the Wind River Range as one area from which they intend to extinguish the grizzly. The explicit intent of Wyoming Game and Fish is to see the extinction of the grizzly bear in the Wind River Mountains including the territory of the Shoshone and Arapaho. The Reservation is sovereign Indian land and the grizzly is a sacred animal to these tribes.,,,Quote from article: Management for these three states means hunting licenses. So a combination of trophy grizzly bear permits and a lack of deterrents for just shooting any old bear on sight could lead to the killing of 100-200 additional grizzlies per year. There are as many as 600 or 700 grizzlies in the greater Yellowstone area.,Quote from article: Climate change or more accurately global warming has precipitated the catastrophic collapse of whitebark pine forests the source of the Yellowstone grizzly bears most important food-- nuts from whitebark pine cones. Grizzly advocates think Yellowstones isolated bear population is in deep trouble.

They add up to a bigger story when they come down at the same time.,,Quote from article: There’s some disagreement on my stance but I see the grizzly’s attempted recovery at plausible risk of being slowed halted and reversed by loss of plant foods caused by a combination of drought and the ongoing crash of insect pollinators — it’s become increasingly evident that a wide range of pollinating insects are in trouble — and CO2-driven loss of plant life’s nutritional support.Alongside that combined risk to the grizzly’s tentative recovery add the combination of increasing recreation demand and residential sprawl has its own potentials for slowing halting and reversing a potentially fragile recovery

The suite of policies identified in current and proposed state grizzly bear management plans the tri-state Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and state laws and administrative rules demonstrate an emphasis on hunting and lethal control of bears rather than on recovery connectivity and conflict prevention. Of particular concern is recent state legislative actions that have demonstrated how regulatory mechanisms are subject to change based on political whims which highlights a lack of durability for regulatory mechanisms post-delisting. ,,,, As increasing numbers of people move to Montana grizzly bear habitat will be developed and subdivided and recreation in grizzly country will accelerate putting further pressure on bears. As the impacts of climate on bears become more pronounced the future of grizzlies in Montana will depend on careful stewardship and a broad suite of conflict prevention strategies. Putting FWPs skills and energies into addressing these issues will better meet the increasing demands of maintaining this grizzly bear population than trophy hunting will. ,,Conflict prevention education and outreach are underfunded and underutilized. While robust state and federal programs exist to respond to conflicts when they occur and provide compensation if those conflicts lead to livestock losses investments in nonlethal conflict prevention lack similar institutional structures for funding and coordination. This lack of stable and predictable financial assistance and absence of a reliable network of technical assistance limits landowner and community participation in conflict prevention efforts thus failing to support adequate implementation of conflict prevention activities in occupied grizzly bear habitat. Grizzly bear recovery and connectivity between ecosystems will not be achieved or maintained without significant state and federal commitments to secure a safer landscape for people and bears by reducing attractants preventing conflicts and ensuring people have the knowledge to live work and recreate safely in bear country.,,,,1) We suggest that FWP reconsider its emphasis on hunting and instead concentrate its investments and energy on monitoring conflict prevention strategies management response when conflict occurs cooperation and coordination with communities Tribes NGOs and other local partners as well as enhanced outreach and education to maintain the health and safety of Montanas grizzly bears while serving the states residents and visitors. 2)  As increasing numbers of people move to Montana grizzly bear habitat will be developed and subdivided and recreation in grizzly country will accelerate putting further pressure on bears.

However due to climate change some bears are switching from eating salmon to eating elderberries as early warming causes the berries to bloom prematurely. Because bears in the archipelago previously ate up to 75 per cent of a salmon population in a region researchers believe the dramatic increase in salmon populations will disrupt the entire food chain on the islands. For example fish carcasses not only enrich the soil around rivers they also provide an important food source to other animals.

Together oil and gas development proposed on the Bridger-Teton Shoshone and Targhee National Forests pose a greater threat to the grizzlies future than the recently defeated New World Mine near Yellowstone Park.In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem 900 new miles of logging roads are planned for the next decade. Timber cutting and road building have destroyed thousands of acres of grizzly habitat since the listing 25 years ago.Private lands containing important bear habitat are being transformed into subdivisions and ranchettes at a runaway pace. And because Yellowstone is surrounded by several of the fastest growing counties in our country there is intense and increasing political pressure to open up the area for development.,,Quote from article: Whitebark pine the seeds of which are a key food source for grizzlies (they contribute to female reproduction and cub survival; when scarce they cause many bears to die) is threatened by introduced blister rust disease as well as global warming which together could wipe out this tree in Yellowstone.In Yellowstone Lake lake trout are predating upon Yellowstone cutthroat and have potentially reduced this important spring food source for grizzlies by 80 percent over the past 20 years.All these factors together add up to a hefty row-to-hoe for the grizzly. Without better protection of important habitat most experts agree that the long-term future of the grizzly bear is dim.

Alternative A would continue existing management practices and assume no new management actions would be implemented beyond those available at the outset of the grizzly bear restoration planning process. Under Alternative A grizzly bears would not be translocated into the NCE.The action alternatives include capturing grizzly bears from outside the NCE and releasing them into the NCE for a period of time that is dependent on the particular alternative. The lead agencies would focus on translocating grizzly bears from areas that are ecologically similar to potential release sites. This may include grizzly bears from British Columbia Canada or the Northern Continental Divide ecosystem. All of the action alternatives include the replacement of translocated bears in the NCE which are lost from the population due to mortality or emigration during the period of initial releases.The option to designate the NCE grizzly bear population as an experimental population under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act could be applied to any of the action alternatives. The DEIS will assess the potential impacts associated with designating or not designating an experimental population under each action alternative; therefore the DEIS will serve as our National Environmental Policy Act analysis for the proposed restoration effort and any 10(j) experimental population rule.Alternative B would involve an initial release of up to 10 grizzly bears followed by a period of monitoring in which additional releases would not occur. The alternative would then either repeat the initial release or default to alternative C as described below. At the conclusion of the initial release there would be a period of adaptive management where additional bears could be released based on a number of factors including human-caused sources of mortality genetic limitations population trends and the adjustment of the sex ratio.Alternative C would involve the yearly release of up to 5 grizzly bears for a 5 to 10-year period to achieve an initial population of 25 grizzly bears. At the conclusion of these releases there would be an adaptive management period where additional grizzly bears could be released based on a number of factors including human-caused sources of mortality genetic limitations population trends and the adjustment of the sex ratio.Alternative D would involve the yearly release of the maximum number of grizzly bears available for capture (anticipated to be 5 to 7 bears) until the minimum population estimate in the NCE reaches 200 grizzly bears.,,,,,,,,,,,

Fish and Wildlife Service has played a vital role since 1975 in reversing the decline of grizzly bear populations in the Northern Rockies a decline states had perpetuated with trophy hunts.

Unfortunately it proved to be little more than a vehicle for promoting premature delisting and limiting grizzlies to isolated island ecosystems—despite overwhelming scientific evidence that lasting recovery can only be achieved by reconnecting grizzly bear ecosystems. In the aftermath Montana undertook a costly and unsuccessful fight to grab power from the federal government reduce grizzly populations and disenfranchise the national Public.The federal government should not tolerate a repeat of this cynical exercise.

It recognized that scientific uncertainty generally calls for deference to agency expertise but explained that it was insufficient for an agency to merely invoke scientific uncertainty to justify an action such as a delisting decision particularly where there is evidence however uncertain of a threat to the species.101 To the contrary FWS needed to rationally explain why uncertainty about the impact of whitebark pine loss on the grizzly bear would justify a delisting decision rather than further study.102FWS again sought to delist the Yellowstone grizzly bear DPS in 2017 which gave rise to another lawsuit. Again the Ninth Circuit found that FWS had failed to justify the delisting decision-however the appellate decision did not touch on climate-related threats or climate science.103,,,,,,,,,,,1)Climate change poses an enormous risk to plant and animal species across the planet.

But their assurances that bears have met recovery goals are cold comfort. Bears are not meeting recovery goals. Last year female grizzly bears were killed at a rate that is unsustainable even by the governments own standards. And the recovery targets are themselves deficient: In 1995 a federal judge rejected the grizzly recovery plan as inadequate to ensure a recovered bear population. That plan has never been fixed. Meeting a flawed plans arbitrary recovery targets is passing the wrong test.If we really have enough bears why is the government planning to truck in an outside grizzly every 10 years to prevent genetic inbreeding in the park? Does this sound like success? The truth is we need to increase the size of Yellowstones bear population to reach true recovery.,,,,,Quote from article: That means protecting habitat which is the real sticking point for the Bush administration. Yellowstones grizzlies need more than just Yellowstone National Park they need the surrounding national forest lands as well. The picture for grizzly bears does not look good if the Endangered Species Act is no longer a roadblock to the aggressive oil and gas drilling logging road-building and mining championed by the Bush administration.Are we willing to make room for the grizzlies or do we expect the bears to learn to read imaginary lines on a map? A third of the habitat currently used by Yellowstones grizzlies gets no protection under the governments delisting plan. The government says it wants to maintain Yellowstones current bear numbers. But it has no plans to protect the more than 2 million acres of national forest lands where grizzlies are currently living let alone the additional national forest lands where bears could roam if we were willing to hold back the coming sea of development.And how do we know that the government will deliver on its half-measure promises to protect habitat outside the national parks? Delisting proponents claim that we can protect the bears habitat through Forest Service plans - the same forest plans that the Bush administration says are aspirational not binding.,Quote from article: Without the Endangered Species Acts protection the number of bears killed will only increase. Wyoming Montana and Idaho have all announced plans to hunt Yellowstones grizzlies on Public lands outside Yellowstone Park as soon as the bear is delisted. Four Wyoming counties that currently host grizzlies have already passed county ordinances to kill bears on sight.,Quote from article: This is not the time to take more habitat away from bears that are already contending with declining food sources. Yellowstones grizzlies rely heavily on the seed cones of whitebark pine. In good years whitebark pines produce lots of seed cones feeding the bears and keeping them in the high country away from trouble. In years when the whitebark pine cone production falters grizzlies produce fewer cubs have many more conflicts with humans and are killed by humans at an unsustainable level. Unfortunately whitebark pines are under attack from a variety of fronts: a foreign disease called blister rust mountain pine beetles and a warming climate. That orange hue increasingly seen in Yellowstones forests is not a good sign for bears. The upshot? More dead bears every year. The agencies response? Well monitor the decline of whitebark and figure out what to do when the crash occurs.

For these reasons we urge FWS to maintain federal protection for grizzly bears across the lower 48 states.,,,,Continental range contraction of grizzly bears over the past two centuries has resulted in four sub-populations within the conterminous USA: Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem and the Selkirk Ecosystem. All four are isolated from one another. Achieving meaningful viability for grizzly bears in the contiguous United States will require genetic and demographic connectivity among existing populations along with full colonization of the Bitterroot Recovery Area. This has yet to happen. Allendorf and others (2019) explained that [n]o existing population includes sufficient numbers to be considered recovered no recovery zone is large enough to accommodate a recovered population and there is no evidence for natural genetic exchange among grizzly bears in all five U.S. subpopulations.5/ Moreover Shafer (2022) found that the genome of the GYE grizzly bear population is too small for long-term adaptation./6,Given this definition current research suggests that for a species such as the grizzly bear with a low reproductive rate and a low ratio of effective to total population size around 2500-9000 animals in a contiguous inter-breeding population are needed to attain long-term evolutionarily meaningful viability./3We are still far from reaching this benchmark for grizzly bears in the contiguous United States. Even the most optimistic estimates for total numbers of grizzly bears in the contiguous United States are in the range of 2100 animals distributed among four isolated or partially isolated populations. Even the largest of these populations--the Northern Continental Divide and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystems--number no more than about 1000 bears each./4 Thus the NCDE and GYE grizzly bear populations continue to qualify for federal protections because their populations are not large enough to ensure viability without meaningful connectivity to other populations. On these findings alone delisting of these two populations of grizzly bears at this time is unwarranted.,,,,,Encroachment of human activities such as agriculture forestry and residential development can result in habitat loss and fragmentation. This reduces the available habitat for grizzly bears and creates barriers to movement hindering connectivity between recovery zones,,

We have tens of millions of cattle in America but we only have about 700 grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which is why we are thrilled that the court sent the agencies back to the drawing board.,,,,,,,,,,,The court found that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services failure to consider limiting the number of female grizzly bears that could be killed was arbitrary and capricious because killing too many females could jeopardize the grizzly bear population in the project area. In so holding the court acknowledged the importance of protecting female grizzly bears for grizzly bear recovery. The decision placed no limits on killing female bears or cubs even though females with cubs live where the proposed killing would be permitted,Adding to the Yellowstone grizzlies many challenges due to global warming the drastic die-off of whitebark pines have decimated the production of their seeds another high nutrition traditional food source forcing grizzly bears to expand their range into less secure habitat where they are often shot and killed for reasons like cattle depredation.

It also demonstrates Americas enduring commitment to wildlife conservation.The National Wildlife Federation - one of the nations largest conservation groups at 4 million members and supporters - has decided to support this proposal only after a thorough review of the facts and documents on which the proposal was based.,,,The success in Yellowstone stands as a sharp rebuttal to those who claim that the Endangered Species Act doesnt work. Americas largest carnivore a species that requires millions of acres of high-quality habitat has been recovered in one key area through the hard work of many people organizations and agencies. The National Wildlife Federation believes this success can and should inspire further success for both grizzly bears and other imperiled wildlife,,Two major reasons led us to our decision: First is the success on the ground. Because of the Endangered Species Acts protections and the focused management efforts it has stimulated the grizzly population in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem has been growing at a rate of 4 percent to 7 percent a year for at least the last 15 years. There are now more than 600 bears in the population. All of the goals set in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Grizzly Recovery Plan have been exceeded in terms of the numbers of male and female bears their age ranges and their geographic distribution.,Bear management plans adopted by Montana Idaho and Wyoming establish goals for expanding the grizzly range far beyond the intensively protected core area. Through these state plans and a Forest Service commitment to adhere to them an additional 6 million acres of Publicly owned habitat with different levels of protection are available for Yellowstones growing grizzly population.,,,,,,

Meanwhile climate change and invasive species have taken a huge toll on two of the bears’ primary food sources whitebark pine seeds and cutthroat trout prompting the bears to prey on livestock outside national park borders leading to increased conflict with livestock ranchers. CBD maintains that drought and climate change are likely to worsen these problems.

We have decades of experience implementing human-grizzly conflict reduction mitigations and facilitating community dialogues to support conservation outcomes.,, Establishing a base for open clear and consistent communication will increase community trust and engagement in management and support the durable and community-owned acceptance of and excitement for sharing the landscape with grizzly bears.,,,,,Access to resources will provide communities and tribes within the BE the tools and capacity to build programs to better adapt to and live alongside grizzly bears. There are variety of on-the-ground conservation and landowner groups as well as tribes in regions like the High Divide that are already working collaboratively to support successful coexistence between humans and bears on the landscape. Specifically weve seen a significant increase in federal funding over the past year from programs like America the Beautiful Challenge grants and the U.S. Department of Agricultures Regional Conservation Partnership Program towards ensuring stability through consistent and permanent funding for co-existence. These efforts could provide a model for future programs and assure landowners and tribal communities that there are tools and funding available (and a clear understanding how to access them) to support coexistence at larger landscape scales.,Tribal Support: Grizzly bears are a cultural and spiritual symbol and presence for many Indigenous Tribes and First Nations across the continent. Tribal nations should be appropriately consulted in the Environmental Impact Process and funding should be provided for their participation to ensure they are able to engage in this process in an equitable just and meaningful way.Further Y2Y stands in support and allyship with tribes noting that key considerations must be given to the Grizzly Bear Treaty signed in 2016 by 170 Nations (Grizzly Bear Treaty 2016).It is our collective intention to recognize the GRIZZLY as an umbrella species central to the ecological system; and to provide a safe space and environment across our historic homelands we once shared with the GRIZZLY where biologically suitable habitat still exists in the United States and Canada so together WE can have our grandparent the GRIZZLY guide us in nurturing our land plants and the other two-legged four-legged and winged beings to once again realize the GRIZZLY MEDICINE WAYS for our future generations and recognize that OUR DRUMBEAT IS THE HEARTBEAT OF THE GRIZZLY. In our collective NATIONS efforts to protect and preserve the GRIZZLY - and by doing so protect preserve and perpetuate indigenous cultures - this treaty is analogous to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP).,,Not only will prioritizing conservation both of core areas AND ecological corridors for grizzly bears help conserve grizzly bears in Idaho Montana and Wyoming - which is fundamental to long-term survival but bears will have the large landscapes to roam minimize interactions with people. Further these large landscapes will also benefit a diverse range of taxa and reduce biodiversity loss during this time of rapid population growth in the area and climate change.,,

It is our position that no grizzly bear should be relocated absent a demonstratable threat to human safety. Removing bears for property damage disincentivizes communities from using proper conflict prevention measures. Moreover relocation may cause injury or death of the bear due to the stress and complications surrounding capture and relocation.To prevent conflicts the Service and its partners should incentivize livestock owners to utilize nonlethal methods to reduce conflicts; educate residents and visitors to be bear aware and practice strict food storage methods and other measures to reduce attractants (such as garbage pet food bird feeders compost etc.); and encourage hunters residents visitors and livestock owners to carry bear spray when venturing into grizzly bear habitat. Nonlethal tools may include fencing fladry range riders guard dogs immediate removal of carcasses and other attractants and scare tools and tactics.13,,,We are also concerned that the current 10(j) rule has an exception for incidental take of bears that could reduce the ability of the Service to mitigate threats to bears - such as logging grazing mining and roadbuilding projects - through section 7 consultation.,,

Additionally the impact on economies when grizzly bear presence has a negative effect on local communities who rely on this recreation can be devasting.,,Resources are limited to keep communities safe from grizzly bears. The state of Idaho is given $25000 from the federal government to help prevent grizzly bear conflict. Another $15000 is given from an NGO which is dedicated to the eastern side of the state. With such little aid from the federal government to help control the problem it exacerbates resources that the state and local communities can devote to dealing with the grizzly bear issue. Communities having to supplement prevention efforts takes away money for other critical needs in that community. As interactions increase with the bears that currently transverse through the western states the state of Idaho has had to appropriate more money to prevention methods and local communities are having to guide their people on how to stay safe when a bear comes close.,,,

The shrill demands of states like Wyoming only amplifies the imperative for the Fish and Wildlife Service to delist bears.,,,,,,,,,,

This shift in perspective happened when legislatures and governors in Montana and Idaho enacted new laws to try and kill wolves through aggressive indiscriminate wildlife killing methods that would harm grizzlies. Science-based state wildlife management was replaced by legislation founded on anti-predator misinformation and emotion.,The ESA works because it is based on science and facts. It specifically requires that delisting decisions must be judged solely on the best available scientific data not on the political interests of members of Congress. I urge you to contact your federal representatives and urge them not to pass legislation circumventing ESA requirements to congressionally delist grizzly bears.,,,It’s not far-fetched to predict that if grizzly bears were delisted by congressional action at this time and turned over to state management that legislatures and governors would do the same thing to grizzlies that they are currently trying to do to wolves: legislatively reduce grizzly numbers inside recovery zones and eliminate most grizzlies outside recovery zones.,,,,Certain members of Congress are attempting to circumvent the ESA and force grizzly bear delisting through Congressional action. This attempt disregards the ongoing erosion of grizzly bear regulatory mechanisms by state legislatures as well as threats to habitat security posed by increased private land development and recreation on Public lands as more people move into grizzly habitat.,,

The National Forest Management Act requires national forests to develop forest plans and ensure that site-specific projects comply with those plans,,,,,,,,,When analyzing how the project would change the amount of land with or without open roads in grizzly habitat the groups argue the Forest Service must analyze the real-world motorized usage of roads to the best of its understanding — including illegal road use — not just which roads are designated as open to motorized use.Grizzly bears tend to die in or abandon roaded forests according to numerous studies collected by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee.,,

Despite the committees unwillingness to address them there remain serious concerns about actual population numbers the population trend over time and the impacts of the loss of key grizzly food sources - as well as the continued isolation of Yellowstone bears from other grizzly populations.,,,It is vital that grizzly bears make a full recovery so they dont slide back towards extinction.

So far the agency has only carried out on-the-ground conservation efforts in the Greater Yellowstone Northern Continental Divide Cabinet-Yaak and Selkirk ecosystems. Despite having developed recovery strategies in the North Cascades and Selway-Bitterroot nothing has been done to recover bears there. Delisting Yellowstone would put recovery in those areas in severe jeopardy and would virtually ensure that no recovery efforts ever occurred elsewhere in the United States.,,Grizzly bears live on only 4 percent of the lands they once roamed in the lower 48 states said Brett Hartl endangered species policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity. If the Service moves to delist the Yellowstone bear population -- one of the few populations the agency has made any effort to recover -- itll declare the job done and close the door on recovering these magnificent animals across other parts of their historic range just as its trying to do with gray wolves.,,,The health of the Yellowstone grizzly bear population has improved -- but its way too early to declare victory and walk away from a species that once roamed as far south as the Sierra mountains of Mexico down the Pacific coast and out onto the Great Plains Hartl said.

Under such radically changing habitat conditions the bear should technically never be delisted. This is not fair to anybody but theyre never going to be recovered. The habitat is going to change so fast in the next 20 years that the grizzlies are going to need three times as much habitat as weve already chosen to give them just to maintain their current numbers.

Proposing a legal hunt on an animal population under the best practices and principles of modern wildlife management requires (a) evidence that the populations reproduction (natality over mortality) is adequate and sufficient to sustain a surplus for harvest without reducing that population and (b) that initiating a legal hunt has broad social acceptance based on the general Publics values in favor of such exploitation. 2)  Neither the federal nor state wildlife agencies have provided evidence that the Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear population has a surplus of bear numbers that can sustain the current rate of mortality without a decline in the population. In the past two years these agencies have proceeded to plan a trophy hunt of grizzly bears which flies in the face of the values expressed in thousands of Public comments the overwhelming sentiment being against hunting these bears. ,Second the production of whitebark pine nuts (one of the two most important grizzly bear foods) while variable depending on the year has declined due to bark beetles and whitebark pine blister rust a disease that is killing large numbers of whitebark pine trees throughout the Rocky Mountains. Indeed scientists have predicted that virtually all of the whitebark pine in the Yellowstone ecosystem is projected to be lost due to the combined effects of disease and global climate change.

The governor wants delisting and for state laws and administrative rules already in place become the primary regulatory and legal mechanisms guiding management.,,Montana FWP monitoring program established in 2004 is sufficient and shows the Distinctive population segment: FWP monitors grizzly bears in the NCDE with the best available science and a team of dedicated specialists. FWP established a monitoring program in 2004 that tracks the survival and reproductive rates of radio-marked grizzly bears throughout the ecosystem. Every known or probable grizzly bear mortality is documented. This long-term program works in cooperation with other state federal and tribal agencies.,,The petition outlined that NCDE grizzly bears are within a distinct population; Beyond seeking to delist grizzly bears in the NCDE the petition also asks the FWS to designate the NCDE bears as a distinct population segment (DPS.) In doing so the petition also seeks to expand the distinct population segment (DPS.) well into eastern Montana. This would allow for the delisting of grizzly bears across most of the northern half of the state.,NCDE GBs have far surpassed population recovery goals. The population warrants handover to the states: Grizzly bears were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1975. At the time the population of grizzly bears in the lower 48 was estimated to be in the hundreds. Today the population in the NCDE alone is estimated at approximately 1100 bears. In accordance with the NCDE Conservation Strategy and administrative rule FWP is committed to keeping a viable and healthy population. In 2018 the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission approved a population objective for the ecosystem to maintain a population size above 800 bears with at least 90 percent certainty. Effectively this would mean managing for a population of approximately 1000 grizzly bears.,1 State agency has the capacity to manage: Montana Fish Wildlife & Parks has the structure in place to successfully take over full management of this iconic native species. FWP director Hank Worsech said: We’ve shown the ability to manage bears protect their habitat and population numbers. It’s time for us to have full authority for grizzly bears in Montana. 2 the state does this management in a defacto way: Although grizzly bears in the lower 48 states have remained under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service much of the day-to-day management is done by FWP’s specialists who work with landowners and the general Public to address conflicts and increase safety and education in bear country.,Human wildlife conflict: As grizzly bear numbers have grown their distribution has expanded particularly in the prairie areas east of the Rocky Mountain Front where they haven’t been in more than a century. This expansion has led to increased conflicts with communities livestock producers and landowners. We worked on grizzly bear recovery for decades. We were successful and switched to a focus on conflict management years ago -FWP director Hank Worsech,,,,,

The recovery of the GYE grizzly bear population is one of the most remarkableconservation success stories in the history of wildlife conservation. This population isone of the world’s most studied populations of wildlife. Despite all science-basedinformation affirming the population’s biological recovery and successfulconservation we continue to be hobbled by the species’ status listed as threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Wyoming is proud to have paid for andtaken a leadership role in grizzly bear recovery and management for the past 45+ years. Wyoming people (primarily those who have purchased hunting or fishing licenses) have invested over $59 million to recover this population from its low point when there were as few as 136 bears in the GYE. Wyoming people have changed how they work live and recreate in grizzly bear country to help with their recovery. The most recent and best available science estimates there are more than 1000 grizzly bears within the suitable habitat of the GYE. ,Proposed law in Congress Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2023,The GYE grizzly bear population is fully recovered as measured by all federally developed recovery criteria. Quantifying and measuring recovery has beenchallenging to say the least. This challenge has not resulted from difficulty with thebiology and science but rather the ever-changing goal posts established by the Serviceand conclusions developed in court decisions by federal judges. Despite thesechallenges I can state unequivocally that for two decades this population has beenbiologically recovered and is healthy and viable. From the stated purposes of the ESAa recovered population is one that: has the capability to offset human-caused mortalityis large enough to ensure a high probability of survival considering demographic andenvironmental stochasticity and has reproductive females distributed throughout therecovery area. The robust dataset for this population affords long-term insight into itsbiological health. It has continually demonstrated a steady increase in abundancedensity and distribution (see upcoming figures). Recent updates in the science usedto estimate abundance provide for more accurate information. Based on all availablemetrics the population exceeds 1000 grizzly bears in the DMA — a number that isdouble the original number needed to deem it a recovered population. Annual grizzlybear mortality has remained below established thresholds despite increasing humancaused mortality due to a growing population. Reproductive females occupy the entireDMA and have for decades. These facts are relevant because they directly tie to therecovery criteria established by the Service informed by recommendations fromgrizzly bear experts. ,,,The recovery of the GYE grizzly bear population is one of the most remarkableconservation success stories in the history of wildlife conservation. This population isone of the world’s most studied populations of wildlife. Despite all science-basedinformation affirming the population’s biological recovery and successfulconservation we continue to be hobbled by the species’ status listed as threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act (ESA).,We firmly believe state and tribal wildlife management agencies are best suited tomanage wildlife within the borders of their respective states. The localized experienceand expertise provide the proper context to inform management decisions and toestablish objectives directing how wildlife populations are managed using the mostcurrent techniques and best available science. In the case of the GYE the states ofWyoming Montana and Idaho played a lead role in the population recovery. From adata collection Public education conflict management law enforcement and researchperspective the states have conducted the overwhelming majority of the work despitethe species’ being under federal authority. 2) The states of Wyoming Montana and Idaho are fully capable of assumingmanagement of the GYE population and in fact have done so when the populationwas previously delisted two times. Speaking specifically for Wyoming we havedemonstrated our abilities to manage and conserve all wildlife populationsthroughoutthe State since the inception of the Department in the early 1900s. O ther speciessuccessfully managed by Wyoming include black bearsmountain lions and gray wolves. 3) As a state and Department we have developed multiple regulatory mechanisms toensure GYE grizzly bears remain recovered into the future including a WyomingGame and Fish Commission and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved GrizzlyBear Management Plan. In addition multiple state statutes and Wyoming Game andFish Regulations codify regulatory mechanisms. For the most recent delisting processthe states of Wyoming Montana and Idaho entered into a three-state memorandum ofagreement to provide assurances regarding the post-delisting allocation ofdiscretionary mortality. 4) Finally The Department’s Large Carnivore Section was created to manage grizzlybears and other large carnivores in a science-based framework that considers Publiccomment while also providing an immediate response to conflicts between carnivoresand humans. The majority of work by this Section in collaboration with regionalDepartment personnel is devoted to grizzly bear monitoring outreach/education andconflict management.,Their expansion in range into unsuitable habitats has created significant challenges forall states and agencies involved due to the ever-increasing rise in human/bear conflictpotential. Dangerous encounters with humans destruction of private property (mostlylivestock) and bear occupancy in human-dominated landscapes are all the reality ofan expanding population. An expanding population was promoted and was the statedobjective for decades but once grizzly bears surpassed the suitable habitat of the GYEthe expansion continued. Now our people deal directly with grizzly bears expandinginto areas that are primarily rural and agricultural communities not pristinebackcountry wilderness sanctuaries. People working living and recreating in theseareas were assured grizzly bears would not be allowed to permanently occupy these areas outside of suitable habitat by the state and federal entities involved in recovery. This promise inspired support for recovery by local citizens. Occupancy in thesehuman-dominated areas far from biologically suitable habitats is not a realistic scenario for success from a human or bear perspective. When evaluating verified grizzly bear conflicts in Wyoming we have documented awidespread increase in conflicts associated with the increased distribution of grizzlybears. The conflict potential has been exacerbated as bears have expanded beyond thosehabitats suitable for their long-term viability. From 1990-1999 we averaged 79conflicts annually. From 2000-2009 that number jumped to 150 annual verifiedconflicts and from 2010-2022 we averaged approximately 220 verified grizzly bearconflicts in Wyoming (see Fig. 5). Based on the combined efforts of our Bear WiseWyoming program community based education programs increased bear resistantinfrastructure in grizzly bear habitats and countless sacrifices and adaptations by thePublic we have decreased the overall conflict potential within the DMA as much ascan be expected. Conflicts associated with property damage garbage and other typesare <10% of all annually verified incidents. Conversely the same cannot be said forconflicts between grizzly bears and livestock with more than 60% of annual incidentsbetween grizzly bears and people being the result of livestock depredationpredominantly cattle. ,We firmly believe state and tribal wildlife management agencies are best suited tomanage wildlife within the borders of their respective states. The localized experienceand expertise provide the proper context to inform management decisions and toestablish objectives directing how wildlife populations are managed using the mostcurrent techniques and best available science. In the case of the GYE the states ofWyoming Montana and Idaho played a lead role in the population recovery. From adata collection Public education conflict management law enforcement and researchperspective the states have conducted the overwhelming majority of the work despitethe species’ being under federal authority. 2) The states of Wyoming Montana and Idaho are fully capable of assumingmanagement of the GYE population and in fact have done so when the populationwas previously delisted two times. Speaking specifically for Wyoming we havedemonstrated our abilities to manage and conserve all wildlife populationsthroughoutthe State since the inception of the Department in the early 1900s. O ther speciessuccessfully managed by Wyoming include black bearsmountain lions and gray wolves. 3) As a state and Department we have developed multiple regulatory mechanisms toensure GYE grizzly bears remain recovered into the future including a WyomingGame and Fish Commission and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved GrizzlyBear Management Plan.

The majority of work by this Section in collaboration with regionalDepartment personnel is devoted to grizzly bear monitoring outreach/education andconflict management.,Since the GYE population was first listed under the ESA the State of Wyoming has invested over $59 million to recover and manage this population. In the last decade alone there has been more than $20 million expended on grizzly bear recovery and management in Wyoming outside Park Service lands and the Wind River Reservation. Wyoming made these investments of nearly $2 million annually despite the fact that the species is listed and we only receive $100000 annually of grizzly bear conservation funding from the federal government. In accordance with the prediscussed expansion of grizzly bears there is a direct increase in Department involvement and funds expended. The strong majority of management costs are paid for from Commission funds. Approximately 80% of the Commission’s revenue is derived from contributions by sportspeople (see Fig. 9). Our financial contributions to grizzly bear conservation further demonstrates our commitment to grizzly bear conservation and management. If GYE grizzly bears remain listed as a threatened population under the ESA the cost of grizzly bear management has the potential to continue to rise with the expansion and increase of the population. As more bears occupy more human occupied areas the potential for conflict and the associated costs stand to rise at a faster pace because bears are more likely to come into conflict in these areas than they are in biologically suitable habitats. Since 2012 approximately 1/3 of all conflicts verified and dealt with by the Department occurred outside the DMAs biologically and socially suitable habitat.,,,

That being recognized this historic act no longer fulfills its original altruistic and noble purpose and the ESA is being used for purposes inconsistent with the intent of the legislation. 2) The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has constantly changed the target population for delisting GYE grizzly bears. In 1982 the USFWS declared that delisting would occur when 300 bears existed in the GYE. By 1993 the USFWS demanded that at least 500 bears needed to occupy the GYE for delisting to occur. In 2017 at least 600 bears needed to exist for delisting to occur. In 2020 pursuant to the recalibration concept as discussed herein the number of bears required for delisting is closer to 1000 bears.,The current method (2016) used to estimate population size is the model-averaged Chao2 population estimator and this method will continue to be used until another scientifically valid method is developed. We eliminated the criterions dependence on a specific method (e.g. Chao2) so that the IGBST can rapidly implement improved scientific methods as they become available in the peer reviewed literature.,,Recovery criteria are nothing more than the identification of factors i.e. healthy number of female bears with cubs appropriate genetic diversity and geographic occupation over areas of suitable habitat to insure that grizzlies remain in the GYE for the foreseeable future.,,,1) The ever increasing population is spilling over into areas well outside of areas where grizzly bears can exist causing loss of human life damage to livestock and seriously eroding Public support for the recovery and existence of this iconic and wonderful creature. 2) When evaluating verified grizzly bear conflicts in Wyoming we have documented a widespread increase in conflicts associated with the increased distribution of grizzly bears. The conflict potential has been exacerbated as bears have expanded beyond habitats suitable for their long-term viability. From 1990-1999 we averaged 79 conflicts annually. From 2000-2009 that number jumped to 150 annual verified conflicts,,,,,

Aasheim considers delisting both a nod of respect to the ESA and the best way to get a handle on an increasing number of bears. The agency has a responsibility by law he says to manage the wildlife within its borders. As far as Aasheims concerned FWP has proven it can meet that responsibility.,,,,,But if theres one aspect of the delisting debate Aasheim doesnt believe FWP was pushing for its hunting. When the agency released its draft hunting framework in May the announcement stated officials expect Montanas allocation of huntable bears to be small-less than 10 in most years and zero in some- and stressed the regulations were designed to minimize harvest of female bears. Licenses would be awarded by draw and cost S150 for resident hunters and $1000 for nonresidents. All this Aasheim says. was done simply to meet the stipulations handed down by the Fish and Wildlife Service.The farthest thing from our minds when we published that for the [FWP] commission to consider was that we were pushing for a hunt he continues. We had to have that in place or they wouldnt even have considered delisting. There had to be that framework.Aasheim adds just because a hunting season is suggested doesnt in any way mean theres actually going to be a season. If or when grizzlies are delisted any proposed hunting regulations will undergo the same process as for any other species starting with a recommendation to the FWP Commission and following up with a Public comment period.Were a long ways from implementing whats on paper Aasheim says. It could be the same it could be changed but complete Public involvement would be a part of the process.,

The traditional counting method the Chao2 estimator which extrapolates population estimates and growth trends from ground and aerial observations of females and their young cubs is prone to overestimation he says. And a newer technique mark-resight which uses a combination of radio-collar tracking and aerial observation is also faulty according to critics in that it can generate population trends that would be biologically impossible. Meanwhile University of Colorado ecologist Daniel Doak found that the aerial search effort had increased substantially over the past 27 years giving the false impression that the Yellowstone population was increasing. This leads folks like Mattson to believe the general population trend has remained stagnant or even declined despite the official counts.,Mattson had openly challenged the scientific basis for removing endangered species protections from the Yellowstone grizzly something the federal wildlife service was eager to push along.,,,,,,In the summer of 1988 28 percent of the whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park burned in devastating fires.

And it also threatened everything that depends on those forests particularly the Yellowstone grizzly bear which relies on whitebark pine nuts as a key source of nutrition
